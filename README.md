<h1>Fake News Detection</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Fake News Detection site. Upload your news article to check its authenticity.</p>
This is just a landing page, and does not yet include any upload form, processing script, or connection to a fake news detection model.

ðŸ§© Suggestions to Extend Functionality:
To make this a complete working app:

Add a file or text input form for users to submit news content.

Use JavaScript or backend (Flask/Django/Node.js) to:

Handle file/text submission.

Call your ML model (e.g., logistic regression, LSTM, BERT).

Display results (Fake/Real with confidence score).

Include feedback or history of checked news items.

Would you like me to help you:

Add the upload form and model integration (frontend + backend)?

Connect this with your existing fake news ML model?

Deploy this on a platform (like Streamlit, Flask, or React)?
